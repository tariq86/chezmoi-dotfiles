# github.com/tariq86/chezmoi-dotfiles

My personal dotfiles, managed with [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

Main changes from [upstream repo]():

- [ ] Remove all personal references (make env vars?)
- [ ] Use Keeper CLI instead of 1Password
- [ ] Remove other services I don't use
- [ ]

Personal secrets are stored in [1Password](https://1password.com) and you'll
need the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/) installed.
Login to 1Password with:

    eval $(op signin)
